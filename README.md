     - I currently work in the venture capital industry, where i am responsible for making investments in early stage technology companies. The comapnies that i invest in develop software that is used to solve problems for their customers. My interest lies in developing a technical understanding of the software development process. Understanding how to read code, and the principles involved in developing and improving code. I think having an ability to do so will improve my analysis of opportunites from an investment perspective.
     - My other interests lie in the prospect of building tools using technology that will assist me in executing my job more efficiently. i am also responsible for building investment tools as well as improve the infrastructure that has been built in the firm where i work, all with the goal of improving the invesment outcomes. Combining my investments knowledge with technology to make my work more efficient is very attractive.
     - I am interested in pursuing additional qualifications in quantitative finance. One of the requirements is learning to use python. So i have an interest in building on the coding languages that i will learn, an improving my ability to learn other languages.

   - What values are important to you in a work environment?
     - Life long learning: It is always important to be continuously learning. This can be in the case of learning about new technologies or new industries. this is necessary to make informed decisions about investments.

     - consistency
     - approach everything that we do from a first principles point of view

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:

   - FinTech, e-Logistics, Data Science
   - I am particularly interested in FinTech, and how technology can be used to build products that make the provision of financial services more efficient.

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:

   - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.
     - There is a strong alignment with my role and skills as these are industries in which i look for opportunities to invest into.
   - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
     - the biggest gap that i have, is not having a deep technical or fundamental understanding of how the technology that drives these industries actually works and is developed

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

   - ## List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
   - To be proficient in HTML, CSS and JS in the the next year, such that i am able to analyse code in any of these languages, i understand what the code is doing. Similarly, i should be able to develop software, such as a fully functional website, that can help make my day to day job more efficient.
   - To learn python, so that i am able to use it to attain a quantitative finance qualification.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

   - In the next 3 years, i should have develped full stack software development skills, and be able to build software that can, combined with existing tools available, automate a significant portion of the investment process where i work.
   - Technology is a tool that should be used to transform the way we operate for the better. developing software development skills will enhance my abilities as an investor by helping me build tools to make the investment process more efficient.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:

   - Complete the Codespace course. This entails thoroughly understanding the material, completing the assignments, and consistently practicing.
   - Using varius other resources to ensure that i entrench a deep understanding of the material.
   - Working iwth others in the class and in the industry to get a different perspective of the learning material.
   -

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:

   - Completing the foundational course is necessary to have a solid foundation on which to build on.
   - Adding additional languages, first one being python. This can be done with online resources, which will now be easier given that i would have learnt 3 coding languages in the Codespace course.
   -

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:

   - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
     - My biggest challenge to reaching my goal is time management. it is challenging to add learning a new skill like software development, while working and fulfiling other personal roles. However, it is necessary as continously learning and perfecting one's craft is the only way to create a sustainable competitive advantage.
   - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.
     - The key strategy is drawing up a plan that consistently allocates time to consuming learning material and practicing the coding skills that one has learnt.
     - It is also important to work with other like minded people, who are either able to teach you what you do not know, or work with you to ti grow your skills

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:

   - Building products and tools using techology that can make my investment process more effcient.
   - adding backend software development skills so that i have a full understanding of how software is built, and applying this in my current role.
   - Attending hackathons, to not only imporve my skills, but expose myself to new ideas and apporaches to software development.
